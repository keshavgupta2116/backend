    Expected expense structure:

    [
        {
            "expense_id": UUID,
            "title": str,
            "paid_by": UUID,

                }
            ]
        }
    ]

    Each expense contains:
    - the user who originally paid (`paid_by`)
    - split entries showing how much each participant owes

    For every split:
    - if the split user is NOT the payer,
      then that user owes the payer their split amount.

    Returns a nested structure in the format:

    {
        debtor_id: {
            creditor_id: [
                {
                    "expense_id": UUID,
